			<h2>Info</h2>
			<p>Designing a calculator web-based interaction with a focus on feedback (Feedback) and playfulness
				(Abstract Adjective) involves incorporating common nostalgic elements of the calculator experience with
				effective simulation of tactile elements and feedback through HTML, JavaScript and CSS to achieve a
				sense of play through actively engaging users.

				Actively engaging with the calculator - pressing buttons and manipulating the interface of the
				calculator fosters a sense of play and exploration. It can make the process of learning maths more
				enjoyable and interactive, leading to better engagement and understanding. The concept of play in
				relation to learning highlights how play allows individuals of all ages to engage in "natural
				experiments" and learn through exploration and experimentation (Gopnik, 2019).<br />

				Calculators have a nostalgic appeal that contributes to their playfulness. Many people have fond
				memories associated with calculators, whether from using them in school or playing with them as toys.
				The tactile nature of calculators plays a significant role in this nostalgia, making them playful and
				charming objects that spark joy and creativity.

				Simulating the tactile feedback of interacting with the physical object by button-pressing can be
				satisfying and playful, as it gives the user a sense of engagement and interaction. The act of pressing
				buttons and hearing the clicks can be enjoyable, reminiscent of playing with a mechanical toy. To
				simulate the feedback of button pressing, Skeuomorphism has been utilised as the design concept of
				making items represented resemble their real-world counterparts in how they appear and/or how the user
				can interact with them (The Interaction Design Foundation, 2015). This design style and effect has been
				achieved using CSS styling: Stacked radial and linear gradients, along with box shadows, have been
				employed to signify and encourage their affordance. By using :hover and :active pseudo-class styling,
				minor changes to scaling, gradients, and shadowing simulate the tactile sensation of pressing a physical
				button, providing satisfying and playful interactions.<br />

				The choice of a digital number font resembling a 7-segment LCD display enhances the playfulness of the
				design (Furr, 1997). This font style not only adds visual appeal but also evokes a sense of nostalgia
				for classic calculators, contributing to the overall playful experience. The calculator display being a
				shade of green is inspired by vacuum fluorescent displays commonly used in calculators. This choice not
				only pays homage to the traditional calculator design but also adds a nostalgic element to the user
				experience.<br />

				To further engage users and recreate the sensation of pressing physical buttons, a JavaScript audio
				function is called on button click. This function provides auditory feedback in the form of a key click
				sound, reminiscent of mechanical toy buttons. This auditory feedback adds another layer of delight and
				engagement to the calculator experience.<br />

				Immediate response plays a crucial role in creating a playful interaction. When users press a button on
				the calculator, the number or function should appear instantly on the display. This immediate feedback
				allows users to see the direct result of their input, reinforcing the cause-and-effect relationship
				between their actions and the calculator's response. The real-time outcomes of their inputs add an
				element of playfulness, enabling users to experiment and explore different possibilities.<br />
				In conclusion, designing a web-based calculator interaction with a focus on feedback and playfulness can
				create an engaging and enjoyable experience for users. By incorporating nostalgic elements, such as the
				tactile simulation of button pressing and the use of a digital number font resembling LCD displays, the
				calculator design evokes a sense of nostalgia and charm. The inclusion of auditory feedback through key
				click sounds further enhances the playful interaction. Additionally, the immediate response of the
				calculator to user inputs reinforces the cause-and-effect relationship, encouraging exploration and
				experimentation. Overall, these design choices and features contribute to an interactive and playful
				calculator experience that not only makes learning maths more enjoyable but also sparks creativity and
				engagement for users of all ages.

				On button click, calls the JavaScript audio function to engage user with auditory feedback (key click),

				Immediate response is crucial in creating a playful interaction. When users press a button on the
